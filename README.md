# Full-Custom-MAC-Unit-Design
This repo contains one single cycle MAC unit design and one two-stage pipeline mac unit design with Carry Bypass Adder (CBA) as accumulator, using radix-4 booth encoding. The design is based on transistors-level, i.e., full-custom design. The original single-cycle design is based on USC EE477L final project, but extend to pipeline design for improving clock frequency.

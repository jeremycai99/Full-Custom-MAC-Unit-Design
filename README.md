# Full-Custom-MAC-Unit-Design
This repo contains one single cycle MAC unit design and one two-stage pipeline mac unit design with Carry Bypass Adder (CBA) as accumulator, using radix-4 booth encoding. The design is based on transistors-level, i.e., full-custom design.

## Key Features
- 8-bit radix-4 booth encoding multiplier
- 16-bit Carry Bypass Adder
- Minimum area design (* um^2 for single-cycle, *um^2 for pipeline)
- Optimized delay performance and maximum clock frequency (with various test cases attached).
- Low power consumption (average *uW for single-cycle @clk_freq, *uW for pipeline @clk_freq)
